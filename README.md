This is a  work in progress  microservice architecture that could be followed to learn SpingBoot Cloud based Microservices.
There is ongoing work to add CI-CD pipeline backed by Git Hub actions , docker and AWS ECS with AWS Fargate 
Below mentioned modules & patterns  are used to create these micro services .
1. Sping Cloud
2. Sping Cloud Apigateway
3. Sping Cloud Config
4. Service Cloud Service Registry
5. Spring Cloud Bus
6. Spring Boot Starter
7. MySql
